Tableau Citi Bike Project
Background
	Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has installed a robust infrastructure of bike rental stations throughout the city.  I was tasked with analyzing the 
	six-month period of Nov/2021-Jun/2022 and presenting the discovered trends from this data.  For this analysis, I created an interactive map showing all
	bike rental stations, second a map showing the top 15 stations, and data for each with a bar graph presenting the rides rentals for each of these 15 
	stations and third I created a storybook showing the total rentals by month, the hour of the day, and a line graph showing the totals by week.


Data Cleaning
Because of my extensive knowledge, I use Excel to clean the data.  I initially downloaded all available Citi Bike Historical files.  I discovered that in 2013 there was a significant change in the data captured.  Several fields were dropped from the data gathering process limiting some analysis that would have         yielded detailed insights into the patterns of the people for the bike rental data.  After reviewing the data, I decided to focus on the most recent data for a   six-month period covering Nov/2021-Jun/2022.  This provides the most current rental patterns and is most relevant to this analysis.  There were some null         records in the data so I removed these nulls rows and cleaned up the date fields.  I also broke apart the original date field into separate date and time         fields.  I left the original date field in the data set.


Findings and observations of the Jersey City Citi Bike rental program.

After creating and analyzing our visualizations, we uncovered the following answer to the city officials' questions on the bike rental trends in the city.  
The presentations include maps, charts, and graphs.

	1)	While there are many bike stations throughout New Jersey, the most popular stations are near the waterfront. The most popular bike stations 
		are demonstrated by the larger green circles on the map and the total number of rentals for the periods Nov/2021-Jun/2022, total rentals, and 
		the station ranking for all stations in New Jersey.
	2)	In the second storybook, the left bar chart presents the bike rental totals for the period Nov/2021 (Winter) through Jun/2022 (Spring/early 			summer).
		The data shows a large drop in the number of bike rides beginning in Dec/2021 and they continue to drop into Jan/2022. Once the harshest part of 
		winter has subsided, the bike rentals begin climbing in February and continue to rise to a high of $103k in Jun/2022. This makes sense.  As the 		weather 
		becomes warmer, bikes become a more popular way to move around the city quickly and easily avoid traffic jams in city. Also, the tourism influx
		hits its peak in the summer. 
	3)	The bar chart on the right demonstrates the most popular times to rent bikes are at 8:00 am and in the early evening at 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm.  
		This coincides with the typical traffic rush hour making it a more convenient and quicker way for workers to move around the city 
		as well as the in-town tourists moving around the city.  The line graph on the bottom presents the most popular weeks of the year correlated 
		which really follows the monthly bike rental trends.  The big bike rental drop-off for the last week of June is because the final week of 
		June only included five days of rentals.
